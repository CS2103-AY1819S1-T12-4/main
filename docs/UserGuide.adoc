== Introduction

Developers usually search google to find solutions to technical problems. However, bookmarking a certain web-page does not tell developers much about for which problem they searched. If developers encounter the same problem again, instead of searching through their bookmarks, it is likely for them to search on google again.

*SaveIt* is geared at keeping track of the issues that users find and linking it with solution web-page found on google. More importantly, SaveIt is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still has the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SaveIt can help you search the entry saved previously faster than traditional GUI apps.


== Quick Start

To get started with SaveIt, please follow the  instructions below:

.  Ensure that Java version `9` or later is installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `saveit.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
<<<<<<< HEAD
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your SaveIt.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
    e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`list`* : lists all issues recorded
* *`add`* : add i/ISSUE_STATEMENT s/SOLUTION_LINK1 s/SOLUTION_LINK2 t/TAG1 t/TAG2 : records an statement with the following links where solutions to the statement were found. The issues can be tagged to help with organization and ease of search.
* *`search`* :  Search ISSUE : searches the records for a certain statement (case-insensitive)
* *`edit`* : edit INDEX i/NEW_ISSUE s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK1 s/NEW_SOLUTION_LINK2…  : edits the details of the 2nd statement in the current list
* *`delete`* : delete 3 : deletes the 3rd statement shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app
.  Refer to Section 3, “Features” for details of each command.
