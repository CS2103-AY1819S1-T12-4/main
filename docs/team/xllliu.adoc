== PROJECT: SaveIt

== 1. Overview

The document is written to summarize my contributions to the CS2103T project.
As a group, we have morphed Addressbook-Level4 into a new bookmark app: SaveIt.
I am mainly in charge in the UI part in the project.

SaveIt​ is geared at keeping track of the issues that the user
finds and their solutions found on the Internet.SaveIt is ​optimized for those who prefer to work with a
Command Line Interface​ (CLI). But it still has the benefits of a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== 2. Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: Redesigned the list panel in GUI
** What it does: It allows the users to view solutions and issues in the list panel
 when they are at the specified directory.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly
because it allows the users to manage the data in the form of a directory system.
 This enhancement is important as morphing changes the original
UI and model structure of Addressbook level 4, the new GUI is more user-friendly.
** Credits: Addressbook level 4.

* *Minor enhancements*: There are three minor enhancements as listed below:
** Added a home command that allows the user to return to home directory for edition.
** Refactored the selection command that allows the user to change edit directory.
** Enabled the user to load solution web-page.

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Selecting an issue/solution  : `(s)select`

If the user is at the home directory, the command selects
 an issue identified by the index number used in the issue panel.
  The command also displays the solutions
  of the selected issue in the solution panel. Now the edit directory
is changed to issue level.

[TIP]
====
* When an issue is selected, the directory is changed to `SaveIt/Issue */`. Then
the user is not allowed to add, edit, or select issue.
The change directory will be displayed in the UI as shown below.
====
Format: `select INDEX`

Example:
****
.Direcotry Change
image::directory-change.png[width="300"]
.Select an Issue
image::select issue.png[width="790"]
****
If the user is at the issue directory, the command load the web link
 of the indexed solution in the built-in browser.

Example:
****
* `select 2`

.Seleting a Solution
image::select solution.png[width="790"]
****



[NOTE]
====
* The index refers to the index number shown in the list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* and `1, 2, 3, ...`
* The index cannot be bigger than the number of issues.
* All properties of this solutions will be displayed at the left side of the interface.
====

=== Returning to home directory  : `(hm)home`

Changes the current editing directory to the home directory. Besides,
 Shows a list of all issues in the list panel by index.

Format: `home`

Examples:
****
* `home`

.Return to Home Directory
image::home.png[width="790"]
****

[NOTE]
====
* All issues are listed in the list panel in home directory.
* The following commands can only be executed at home directory:
 `sort`, `addtag`, `refactortag`, `find`, `findtag`.

== 4.Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project._
|===

=== Directory Level Model

SaveIt manages a list of issues, with each issue containing a list of solutions.
 To manage the data with two-level structure, SaveIt implemented a directory model
  in the Model component and UI component.

==== Current Implementation
Currently a directory class is maintained in `SaveIt`. It consist of `root` level and `issue` level.
 The solution level is disabled for now as the complexity of current version of SaveIt
  does not require the three-level directory system.

===== Command Execution

Before any command is executed,
 it will query the current directory and determine the command result.
  Some commands will have different command word and command result at different directory, such as:
  `edit`, `add`. Some commands can only be executed at root level
  , such as `sort`, `addtag`, `refactortag`, `find`, `findtag`.

===== Home Command

To traverse between `root` and `issue` level, a new command `home` is added to the command list.
`home` Command changes the current directory to `root` level and post `DirectoryChangedEvent`,
 which invokes the UI to load the issue list in the list panel. It is shown in the sequence
 diagram below

.Home Command Sequence Diagram
image::HomeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: How to manage the issues and solutions with two-level structure

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a directory level model explicitly.

** Pros: The data structure is clearer. Target users are familiar
 with director level system, such as file system in Linux.

** Cons: Changing directory may be inconvenient for users.

* **Alternative 2:** Manage the issue-solution structure by specifying index in commands.

** Pros: No need to change the previous structure.
** Cons:The structure is not clear and the users may be confused.

=== UI Enhancement
The figures below show the current UI for SaveIt v1.4.

.SaveIt UI Displaying Solution List
image::UI2.png[width="790"]

In the above figures, the left column is the list panel which displays the list of issues or
the list of solutions. The browser panel at bottom right displays the web page of the url as in the solution link.
When no page is loaded, it displays the default page as above. Whenever a solution is selected,
the browser panel loads the url given in the solution link as below.

.Browser Panel loading Web-Page
image::after selecting solution.png[width="790"]

==== Current Implementation
Currently the list panel implements a two-level structure. When the directory is at root level, it displays
a list of issues. When the directory is at issue level, it displays the solution list of the selected issue.
The list panel interacts with other components through `DirectoryChangedEvent` and `JumpToListRequestEvent`.
The sequence diagram is as shown below.

.Change From Solution List to Issue List
image::UI_Sequence_Diagram_1.png[width="790"]

.Change from Issue List to Solution List
image::UI_Sequence_Diagram_2.png[width="790"]

==== Design Consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use one panel and switch between the two list.
** Pros: The panel takes less space. It also represents the directory structure model in UI.
** Cons: Need to switch between lists. Cannot display the issues while displaying the solutions.

* **Alternative 2:** Use two panels to display the issue list and solution list.
** Pros: Both lists can be viewed at the same time. Implementation is easier.
** Cons: It takes too much space in the UI.
