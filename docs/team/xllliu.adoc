== PROJECT: SaveIt

== 1. Overview

SaveIt​ is geared at keeping track of the issues that the user finds and to link it with the url of the web-page found on the Internet.
More importantly, SaveIt is ​optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface​ (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== 2. Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: Redesign the solution list panel in GUI
** What it does: allow the users to view solutions in the list panel when they select a sepecific issue.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to view the different solutions of an issue and load the web-page of the solution seperately. This enhancement is important as morphing changes the original UI structure of Addressbook level 4, the new GUI is more user-friendly.
** Credits: Addressbook level 4.

* *Minor enhancement*: There are three minor enhancements as listed below:
** Add a home command that allows the user to return to home directory for edition.
** Refactor the selection command that allows the user to change edit directory.
** Enable the user to load solution web-page.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Manage releases `v1.2`, `v1.4` (2 releases) on GitHub
** Documentation:
*** Add cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._

=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The figure above shows the breakdown of the smaller components involved in the `UI` Component. The `UI` Component is the interface (abstraction barrier) between the user and the underlying components - `Model` and `Logic`.

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.
