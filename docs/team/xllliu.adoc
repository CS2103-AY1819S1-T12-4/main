== Overview

SaveIt​ is geared at keeping track of the issues that the user finds and to link it with the url of the web-page found on the Internet.
More importantly, SaveIt is ​optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface​ (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: Redesign the solution list panel in GUI
