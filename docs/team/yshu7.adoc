== PROJECT: SaveIt

---

== Overview

This document is written for summarizing my contributions in the project SaveIt.

SaveIt is geared at keeping track of the issues that the user finds and to link it with the email found on google.
More importantly, SaveIt is ​optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface​ (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It is designed for programmers who are used to CLI applications and are good at typing.

SaveIt​ is implemented for applying CS2103 learning outcomes and show understanding of the software design.
It is written in Java and JavaFX, and is morphed from AddressBook-level4, the application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to sort issue list*
** What it does: allows the user to sort issues shown.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view the issues in the order that they want.
